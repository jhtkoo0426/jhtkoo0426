# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Justin!

Welcome to my GitHub page! I am a software engineer specializing in Machine Learning, with a growing interest in FinTech. I am open to opportunities in the FinTech/SWE space.


### A bit about me ðŸ˜„
- I am from Hong Kong and am currently based on London, UK (6 years and counting).
- I am deeply passionate about creating intelligent systems that learn and adapt, just like myself.
- I have worked in multi-disciplinary teams on primarily ML-based projects.
- I've delved into intriguing applications of technology in finance, especially algorithmic trading and market making.

### My Experinces âŒ›
- **Freelance** (Sept 2023 - Present): Fine-tuned LLMs for Chinese text generation and leveraged AWS S3 to store model artifacts for efficient querying.
- **Research Project Student** (Oct 2022 - May 2023): Experimented with various ML models (regression, MLP) to predict robotic grasp stability.
- **System Engineer** (Oct 2021 - Apr 2022): Contributed to an NLP project to aid NHS practitioners with no-code tools for analysing patient concerns, with an aim to reduce phone consulation queueing times.
