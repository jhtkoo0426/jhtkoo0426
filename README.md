# Hi there 👋, I'm Justin!!
I'm currently studying towards a Bachelors degree in Computer Science at University College London. 

At the moment, I'm focused on discovering the depths of machine learning (and learning to trade on the side for a few quick bucks 😎). I hope to someday be able to develop a sit-back-and-relax trading bot that can perform well even when the market takes a dive!

### Work Experience
- 💻 UCL Industry Exchange Network (Oct 2021 - May 2022): Built a webapp solution for a client alongside 2 coursemates under the UCL IXN programme. We successfully developed a Django web platform for NHS employees to analyse voice recordings or text messages, via natural language processing libraries like Gensim and spaCy. I learnt a lot about frontend design, hosting servers and connecting databases in the project!

- 🏫 Look4SchoolsUK (Apr 2020 - Present): I've been working part-time at Look4SchoolsUK as a business analyst, collecting and analysing data on the performance and other aspects of UK schools. Though my job title is "Business Analyst", I've also helped the company with designing its website's flow, and developed a simple Django prototype webapp to demonstrate the process, as well as trying out various UI designs.
