# Hi there 👋, I'm Justin!

I am a Computer Science (BSc) graduate from University College London, with a special focus on data analytics and machine learning.

### Work Experience
- 📦 **UCL Final Year Project (Oct 2022 - April 2023)**: I collaborated with academics from the <a href="https://www.sml-group.cc">Statistical Machine Learning Group (UCL)</a> on my dissertation project. I created a data collection pipeline for gathering tactile and visual data via Pybullet (a Python physics simulation tool on Linux). Using this data, I successfully trained a Multilayer Perceptron neural network to predict whether a given grasp configuration (tactile and visual data of a robotic arm's perception of its environment) would infer a successful grasp or not, and achieved 76% accuracy on an unseen dataset. With a well-trained network, it can be used to supervise a robotic arm to readjust its grasp on objects if it predicts the initial grasp attempt to be unsucessful.

- 💻 **UCL Industry Exchange Network (Oct 2021 - May 2022)**: I was fortunate to participate in the exchange network with 2 coursemates on a Natural Language Processing project. We were able to apply our knowledge in software development cycles (gathering requirements, prototyping, testing, etc.) to develop an end-to-end solution for our client.

- 🏫 **Look4SchoolsUK Ltd. (Apr 2020 - Present)**: I worked at Look4Schools, an edtech company, as a part-time business analyst. I completed ad-hoc tasks in collecting, analysing and visualising UK school data. My biggest achievement at Look4Schools was volunteering to design and implement a webapp prototype using Django. The prototype improved the web application's flow and were adopted by the Chief Executive of the company.
