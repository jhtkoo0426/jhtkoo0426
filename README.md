# Hi there 👋, I'm Justin!
I am a final year student studying for a Bachelors in Computer Science at University College London. Meanwhile, I'm deep-diving into machine learning and fine-tuning my trading bot for stocking trading as leisure.

### Work Experience
- 💻 UCL Industry Exchange Network (Oct 2021 - May 2022): Built a Django webapp solution for a client alongside 2 coursemates under the UCL IXN programme. The webapp was created to assist NHS employees to analyse voice recordings or text messages, via natural language processing libraries like Gensim and spaCy. I self-learnt a lot designing databases efficiently, incorporating UX/UI design and server hosting to turn it into a live project for practical use.

- 🏫 Look4SchoolsUK Ltd. (Apr 2020 - Present): I've been working part-time as a business analyst, assisting the workflow design, collecting and analysing data for Look4Schools which is an edtech company. I volunteered to improve the web portal using Djanjo and my recommendations were adopted by the Chief Executive of the company.
